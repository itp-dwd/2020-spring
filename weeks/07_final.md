## Next Steps

For many of you this is just the beginning of a wonderful and challenging career in web development. There's still so much to learn!

For those of you looking to take your skills to the next level, you can refer to the guides provided here in the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/). 

In the class we talked a lot about fundamental skills - skills and awarenesses that will serve you well as you explore more complex libraries and technologies that rely on a strong grasp of these fundamentals. 

To continue your open education, you may consider diving into the [Deep Dive into Modern Web Development Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/). It is truly excellent. 

Other courses I can recommend:
* [Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp - UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-advanced-web-developer-bootcamp/)
* [Advanced CSS and SASS course - UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/)

## Conclusion

This concludes our 7-week course, Dyanmic Web Development. We hope you enjoyed learning with us and hope you can continue referring back to the projects and references provided in the Guides and lectures. Take care + So long!
