  * Assets (Images, Fonts, Videos, etc.)


### Part 2: Deployment
* Your source code is pushed to a repository on GitHub
* Your web application is deployed to Heroku
  * Your `package.json` should list all of the necessary npm libraries in order for you application to run in `dependencies`. Make sure you have a `start` script (`"start": "node server.js"`)

### Part 3: Documentation
You must have a `README.md` that contains:
* how to set up and run your application
* links to your design documents, and/or the images inline

### Part 4: Presentation

As a result of remote classes due to coronavirus, we are going to ask you to do the following:
**BEFORE**:
1. Following the [Screen Recording Guide](../guide/../guides/screen-recording.md), make a MAXIMUM 3-minute video presenting your project. In this video, you will:
   1. Introduce yourself: "Hello my name is Joey and I am a X year at NYU's ITP Program."
   2. Introduce your project: "In this video, I am presenting my project for Dynamic Web Development 2020. My project is a web application that does X, Y, and Z. Let me show you how it works."
   3. Show your project and talk through what you are doing. 
   4. Cite and reference your work: "This project is built on Node.js and Express.js, Glitch.com for hosting, and MongoDB Atlas for database hosting. (and any additional acknowledgements you want to give, wink wink, nudge nudge)". 
   5. Conclude your presentation: "This concludes my presentation. Thank you for tuning in. Good bye."
2. You will upload your video to Youtube or vimeo (your choice) and submit the URL using the usual assignment submission form **along with your github repo and glitch project**. 

**DURING**:
1. We will tune in to Zoom which is our remote classroom meeting application (we will send out the zoom info closer to the date)
2. Your instructor will walk through each of the videos and play them during our usual session time. 
3. We will have a shared google doc where you and your classmates will all provide feedback to each other during the video as it plays. 
4. Your instructor will make some verbal comments and also highlight some of your classmate feedback. 
5. We will conclude our class. 

**AFTER**:
1. You will receive feedback and comments on your respective grading Documents. 


<s>On March 23rd, there will be in-class presentations. They will be **6 minutes** each, plus **2 minutes** for feedback and questions. They will be timed so that we can get through everyone!
There will also be guest critics:
* Section 1, Joey's section
* Section 2, Cassie's section
  * [Jenn Schiffer](http://jennmoney.biz/), Director of Community Engineering at Glitch
  * [Myles Borins](https://twitter.com/MylesBorins), Google Cloud Developer Advocate and Node.js Contributor
