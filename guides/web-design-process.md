## Web Design(ing)

Building front end web applications is about addressing both the **visual design** of the client facing interface and the **functionality** of the web application. 

In this class, we briefly introduce you to the the basic process and components of web design and then address how these designs come to materialize through code.

## Research: User Resarch, Defining Requirements, Moodboards, and Inspiration

**Research**: Before anything else, any and every good design process will begin with **research**. Researach about your users, their needs, their desires, their pain points, their delights, what motivates them, what inspires them, what scares them, what keeps them engaged, what truly benefits them, and so on. 

**Requirements**: Your research will inform **the requirements** for your application. Does your design need to be interactive or is it a passive interaction? Does the subject warrant a certain color palette? Do certain typographic considerations need to be made based on your users or based on the briefing from your client or company's style guide? Does your site need to allow people to log-in to a service? Do you need to display data on the site? Based on questions such as these, you will define a requirements list of what **features** and **functionality** the front-end of your site/application will need. You can also add your own "nice-to-haves" section!

**Moodboards & Inspiration**: Simultaneously while you're researching and defining and refining your requirements, it helps to being collecting materials that can inform your web application's design concept. You can use services like [Are.na]() or [Pinterest]() or just use a folder full of images to collect inspiration of websites, images, interaction types, typography, colors, layouts, etc that might come to influence your visual design.

## Sketching

The reality is that there's a lot of overhead to coding, especially when it comes to refactoring and entire code base, updating entire layouts due to a change in design, having to change colors, typography, font-sizes, and more. The point of sketching is to help you put your ideas on paper, to get feedback on those ideas, to assess the viability and appropriateness of your solutions to your/incoming requirements and more. 

Your sketches can be as epic or as simple as you desire, but the point is to have visual material that you can use to ask yourself and others if the requirements you've defined are being addressed in your structure and layout. The structure and layout defined in your sketches can be made clearer when you create wireframes. What are wireframes you ask? Find out in the next section!

## Wireframing

![Wireframe example from Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Profilewireframe.png)

[Wireframing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe) is the process of taking what you've done in your sketches, considering your requirements, and beginning to translate those ideas into a more clear [information architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture) which will eventually lead to a visual design. Wireframing is a *process* and not just a *product* of work that you do as a web designer/developer that allows you to identify "the practicality of a design concept" and to identify functionality, user flows, and experience of your application. It is by nature, iteritive and meant to help you reduce the overhead to major code changes downstream. The idea is to resolve your interactions and flows in the wireframes before moving on to production (though it can be helpful to begin *prototyping* with code in tandem).

As written in the [Wireframe Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_wireframe):
> A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose...The website wireframe connects the underlying conceptual structure, or information architecture, to the surface, or visual design of the website. Wireframes help establish functionality and the relationships between different screen templates of a website. An iterative process, creating wireframes is an effective way to make rapid prototypes of pages, while measuring the practicality of a design concept. Wireframing typically begins between “high-level structural work—like flowcharts or site maps—and screen designs.” Within the process of building a website, wireframing is where thinking becomes tangible.*


## Visual Designing

![Example Visual Design from Dribbble, Zarah Rosiana](https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/3961357/screenshots/9511356/media/73dcdfa79eb5f0acd795127a94a91290.png)

While wireframes will begin to look and feel like the final design of your application, the **visual design** of your application is what you envision your application to look like in the end. This means adding all of the elements that will be on the final pages, even the real copy (e.g. text). Your visual design will include the image assets, styled buttons, correct margin spacing, colors, and typography. The v**isual design is your map** to how you will develop the front end of your web application and will be the metric of your success for your front end code.


## Style Guide

The style guide is your reference for all things related to the design of your application. This includes the specifications for all the aspects of your application that need specifying such as:
* logos
* colors
* typography
* iconography
* illustrations
* buttons/links
* input forms styles
* navigation
* and more...
